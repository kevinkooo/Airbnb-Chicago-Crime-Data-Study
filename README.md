## Business Case and Objectives

In today's competitive accommodation market, understanding the dynamics of pricing can offer a significant advantage. For platforms like Airbnb, where pricing isn't uniformly set by a central entity but by individual hosts, there are multiple variables influencing cost. Recognizing these determinants in a major city like Chicago can equip hosts with the knowledge to optimize their pricing strategies. On the flip side, guests can make informed decisions based on the findings, ensuring they get the best value for their money. Furthermore, Airbnb as a platform can utilize this information for better-targeted marketing strategies, personalized recommendations, and enhanced user experience.
